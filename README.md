# Machine learning

I'm taking Andrew Ng's/Stanford University's machine learning [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera, but instead of using the Matlab templates provided by the course, I'm implementing everything from scratch in Python.

Contents:

* **Ex1: Linear regression**

   With one variable and with multiple variables.

* **Ex2: Logistic regression**

   Including regularization.

* **Ex3: Multi-class classification  and neural networks**

   Handwritten number recognition using two different methods: one-vs-all logistic regression, and forward propagating a pre-trained neural network.

* **Ex4: Neural networks learning**

   Build and train a neural network, including backpropagation, and use it for handwritten number recognition.

* **Ex5: Regularized linear regression and bias vs variance**

   Including learning curves and polynomial regression.

* **Ex6: Support Vector Machines**

   6.1: Demonstrating scikit-learn SVMs with linear and Gaussian kernels on some sample 2D datasets.

   6.2: Building an email spam classifier using natural language processing and a scikit-learn SVM.

* **Ex7: K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis**

   7.1: Build a k-means clustering algorithm and use it for image compression.

   7.2: Build a PCA algorithm and use dimensionality reduction for image compression and for visualisation.
