I'm taking Andrew Ng's/Stanford University's machine learning [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera, but instead of doing the exercises in the recommended Matlab/Octave I'm implementing everything from scratch in Python.

Contents:

* **Ex1: Linear regression**

   With one variable and with multiple variables.

* **Ex2: Logistic regression**

   Including regularization.

* **Ex3: Multi-class classification  and neural networks**

   Handwritten number recognition using two different methods: one-vs-all logistic regression, and forward propagating a pre-trained neural network.

* **Ex4: Neural networks learning**

   Build and train a neural network from scratch, including backpropagation, for handwritten number recognition.

* **Ex5: Regularized linear regression and bias vs variance**

   Including learning curves and polynomial regression.

* **Ex6: Support Vector Machines**

   **6.1**: Demonstrating scikit-learn SVMs with linear and Gaussian kernels on some sample 2D datasets.

  **6.2**: Building an email spam classifier using natural language processing and a scikit-learn SVM.
