I'm taking Andrew Ng's/Stanford University's machine learning [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera, but instead of doing the exercises in the recommended Matlab/Octave I'm implementing them from scratch in Python.

Contents:

* Ex1: Linear regression (with one variable and with multiple variables)
* Ex2: Logistic regression (including regularization)
* Ex3: Multi-class classification (one-vs-all classification for handwritten number recognition) and neural networks (forward propagate a pre-trained NN for handwritten number recognition)
* Ex4: Neural networks learning (build and train a NN from scratch, including backpropagation, for handwritten number recognition)
* Ex5: Regularized linear regression and bias vs variance (including learning curves, polynomial regression)
