I'm taking Andrew Ng's/Stanford University's machine learning [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera, but instead of doing the exercises in the recommended Matlab/Octave I'm implementing them from scratch in Python.

Contents:

* Ex1: Linear regression
* Ex2: Logistic regression
* Ex3: Multi-class classification and neural networks
* Ex4: Neural networks learning
* Ex5: Regularized linear regression and bias vs variance
